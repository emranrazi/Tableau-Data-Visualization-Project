# Tableau Data Visualization Project

This repository contains guidelines and steps to create visualizations using Tableau Public and a dataset named BirdStrikeData. The step-by-step instructions guide users through the process of visualizing bird strike data to understand the impacts across different states and time frames.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Tableau Public:** Download and install [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download) or use the free trial of Tableau Desktop.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is 'BirdStrikeData', which can be downloaded from D2L or provided separately.

## Getting Started

To generate visualizations using Tableau and the 'BirdStrikeData' dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Tableau:** Obtain Tableau Public or the free trial of Tableau Desktop from the official Tableau website.

2. **Data Upload:**
   - Open Tableau and upload the 'BirdStrikeData' Excel file.
   - Navigate to "Sheet1" in the bottom left of the Tableau interface.

3. **Creating Visualizations:**
   - Generate a bar chart showcasing bird strikes by state:
      - Drag the "Number of Records" field to Columns and the "Origin State" field to Rows.
   - Explore geographical heat maps for bird strikes:
      - Click on "Show Me" and select the geographical heat map option.
      - Adjust color options and ensure the map location is set to the United States.

4. **Additional Visualizations:**
   - Create a bar chart based on the cost of bird strikes by state.
   - Sort the bars based on costs and exclude any unwanted data points as necessary.
   - Display the weekly trend of strikes over time by adjusting the FlightDate field.

5. **Building a Dashboard:**
   - Create new sheets for different visualizations.
   - Utilize a new dashboard by dragging and organizing the sheets systematically.
